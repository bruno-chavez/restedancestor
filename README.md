`restedancestor` is a pretty simple REST API, 
that delivers quotes from Darkest Dungeon's Narrator, named Ancestor, 
in JSON format. 

##  Online

`restedancestor` is currently online at 
https://restedancestor.herokuapp.com, 
skip to the 
[Routes](https://github.com/bruno-chavez/restedancestor/tree/master#routes) 
section to see how you can consume the API.

## Local Use

`restedancestor`'s master branch can be used 
to deploy a local copy for development, 
testing or for whatever fits your needs.
You can either download a binary or compile it yourself, 
either way follow the instructions below.

### Executables:

`restedancestor` supports Linux, Windows and Mac, but you need 
to compile it yourself since the project uses CGO, 
cross-compiling can't be enabled.

#### From source code:

Requires Go to be installed on your machine. You can install Go from
[here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Once installed, and with a correctly configured GOPATH, 
on terminal type:

```
$ go get github.com/bruno-chavez/restedancestor
```

Then go to:

```
$GOPATH/src/github.com/bruno-chavez/restedancestor
```

And last, on a terminal type:

```
$ make install
```

##### Usage

Once installed and depending on how you installed the API 
you should see a message like this:

```
$ restedancestor
Welcome to restedancestor, the API is running in a maddening fashion!
The Ancestor is waiting and listening on port 8080 of localhost
```

You can communicate with the API in various ways, 
for example going to your browser and typing on your search 
bar `localhost:8080`, followed by one of the routes listed on 
the Routes section. 
If successful you should see something like this:

There are more complete ways of doing requests to the API, and choosing one depends completely on preference, if you like Desktop Apps [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a pretty powerful tool, prefer web tools? check [Hurl it](https://www.hurl.it/), like CLI apps? [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) is good enough for the job.
